Maker-Project
=============
Pseduo Economy/Transport

Here are some instructions on how to use the program:

Shortest path: Pause the program and then left click on a gnome. Now left click on the village you would like the gnome to go to using the shortest path.

Pseudo Economy: Pause the program and right click the gnomes or village to get their stats.

Adding a gnome: A gnome can only be added after a village has been created. A gnome will randomly spawn at a village.

Creating a road: Right click a village and drag it to another village. Two way roads can be created.

Resource costs: The costs of each resource sold at a village is based on its distance from the resource site. You can drag the villages and the costs of the resources will change.

The program holds the basic functions necessary for the project. There topological sort in our code but it is never utilized because it is not practical in the program. There is also a minimum spanning tree, which is altered to create cycles, which is more practical in the program.

In addition to the basic functions, a pseudo economy has been added. Each gnome is spawned with a random amount of money and resources, and it uses these supplies to survive. As time passes by, their supplies are depleted, and they must successfully maneuver the economy by selling resources at higher prices than they bought them from to extend their lifespans. There is also a toll every time the gnomes get on a road, and this money gets sent to the two adjacent villages.
